Here is a google drive link to the folder that is a collaboration between all the components (Final Project)

-- Additional RTMC-HG_V2.exe is present as a standalone application (Downloading and Installing it is sufficient, Python or any other imports are not necessary to be installed separately.)

(All the imports necessary are available inside the venv folder, that can be directly used after downloading the folder and creating a project with it in pycharm)
