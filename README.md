This project focuses on solving the complication of controlling a robotic arm from a remote location using hand gestures.
There are individual files in this repository like OpenCV data capture, Firebase_db_upload that comprises .py code files for individual tasks and testing purposes, while the CollabMFO Final contains the final .py code file that is a collaboration between OpenCV, Deep Learning, IoT, and an application file that have been created from the .py file which is a stand-alone working application.
